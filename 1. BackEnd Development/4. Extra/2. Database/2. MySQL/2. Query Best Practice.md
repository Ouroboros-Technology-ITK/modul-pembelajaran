Slow Queries
• Avoid using expression or function, it can't use index

× SELECT * FROM books WHERE created_at + INTERVAL 1 DAY = NOW()
× SELECT * FROM books WHERE lower (title)

OR query can't use index, avoid if possible

• Avoid using JOIN since it affects performance if the query retrieve large amount of data
• Avoid SELECT *, SELECT only needed fields

Join
SELECT id, email
• Avoid joining > 2 tables
• If needs to join > 2 tables, do denormalize the table instead
• Put a smaller row table on the left side of LEFT JOIN and INNER JOIN
• Ensure columns used in JOIN clause have index
• Ensure columns used in JOIN uses the same data type and encoding. Otherwise the JOIN can't use index
Select
• EXPLAIN query before running in production
• Select column as needed to keep memory usage as low as possible
Conditional
• Avoid sorting data for large result (>1000 row)
If sorting is needed for large result, sort with indexed column
• Put wildcard characters at the end of a word while searching using the LIKE keyword
• X select fname, Iname, product from products where username like '%mad'
⚫ select fname, Iname, product from products where username like 'muh%
• Avoid using not equal operator ( <> and not)
• Use not exist instead of not in for large table or subquery
X select Iname, fname from users where user_id not in (select user_id from product where
user_id= users.user_id)
✓ select Iname, fname from users where not exist (select 1 from product where
users.user_id=product.user_id)
• Range
• Put upper and bottom range
• where created_at >= mm-dd-yy and created_at <= mm-dd-yy)
• Avoid calculating range
· X where NOW() created_at <= 1 day
⚫ It can't use created at index.
⚫where created_at >= NOW() 1 day
It can use created_at index.
calculate in app layer
X where year (created_at) = 2020
✓where created_at >-'01-01-2014 0000' and created at < 01-01-2021 0000
• Avoid select count distinct
• Use select count and group by combination
• X select count (distinct hostgroup_id) from mysql_servers
⚫ select count (hostgroup_id) from mysql_servers group by hostgroup_id
• Use index on update conditional as update is doing select first
• If update use more than 1 condition use composite index
⚫ update a set b=c, x=y where w=123 and z=xyz
⚫ must contain an composite index of (w, z)
