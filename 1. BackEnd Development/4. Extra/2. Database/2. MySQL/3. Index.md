• Naming convention: prefix_tablename_columnname • Prefixes:
• PK for primary keys
• IX for non-clustered indexes
• UC for unique indexes
• FK for foreign key
• Avoid using index with low cardinality column
⚫e.g. gender will probably only have 3 values: male, female, other
• Use composite index whenever possible
☀-
• Index(a), index(b) is not the same as composite index(a,b) since the DB only chooses 1 best index when querying
• Pay attention to column order in composite index
•
idx_product_user: (user_id, product_id, device_id)
• X select username, product, device where product_id=y and user_id=x and device_id=z
• It can't use the composite index
✓ select username, product, device where user_id=x and product_id=y and device_id=z
• Put index equality before range
·
ix_product_product (product_id, created_at)
⚫ product_id first since it's more likely to be compared with equality
•
created_at later since it's more likely to be compared with range
• Conditions after range won't use index
• Limit composite index to 5 column
